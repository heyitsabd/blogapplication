    "title": "Understanding React Components",
    "description": "React components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow developers to create reusable pieces of UI, encapsulating both logic and rendering. Each component can maintain its own state and lifecycle, making it easier to manage complex UIs. Components can be classified into two types: **class components** and **functional components**. Class components use ES6 classes, while functional components are simpler and often enhanced with hooks for state and side effects. By composing components together, developers can create intricate interfaces while promoting code reusability and maintainability. This modular approach simplifies the development and testing process in React applications.",
